Hi, I'm an Italian MD with a pinch of programming knowledge.  

I enjoy making tools that can aid me during my work;

So, I made this program to make much faster for the doctor to calculate the updated dosage of warfarin, a drug used to prevent blood clots;
usually the dosage must be updated every 7-14 days, based on the INR of the patient.

So I tought that a tool that can help us calculate with precision the new dosage and to automatically subdivide it equally in the week, would be a help!
